Started coding: dec, 2018.

Tasklist I made with JavaScript from a udemy course. 

We can add tasks to the list and save them on local storage. 

When there are tasks in the list you can filter them.

You can delete a task by clicking on the right cross icon or delete them all together by clearing tasks.

I've added a lot of comments to explain what everything does.
